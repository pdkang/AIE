That's essentially the plot of the movie. John Wick (Reeves) is out to seek revenge on the people who took something he loved from him. It's a beautifully simple premise for an action movie - when action movies get convoluted, they get bad i.e. A Good Day to Die Hard. John Wick gives the viewers what they want: Awesome action, stylish stunts, kinetic chaos, and a relatable hero to tie it all together. John Wick succeeds in its simplicity.\")"

As he embarks on this mission, he faces numerous challenges and encounters various assassins, all of whom are drawn to the substantial bounty placed on his head due to his reputation as a legendary hitman.\\n\\nIn \"John Wick 2,\" after resolving his past issues with the Russian mafia, John Wick returns home, only to be confronted by mobster Santino D\\'Antonio, who demands his assistance in fulfilling a blood oath.

        "## Key Findings and Conclusions on retriever performance\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Best Overall Performance: The Ensemble Retriever demonstrates the highest overall performance with exceptional context recall (0.9667) and strong entity recall (0.7333). This suggests that combining multiple retrieval strategies provides the most comprehensive results.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Best Precision: The Contextual Compression Retriever (using Cohere's reranker) achieves the highest context precision (0.8083), indicating it's most effective at retrieving highly relevant documents while minimizing irrelevant information.  \n",
        "\n",
        "3. Worst Performance: The BM25 Retriever significantly underperforms across all metrics, particularly in context precision (0.1417) and recall (0.3000). This suggests that keyword-based retrieval alone is insufficient for complex queries about movie reviews.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Balanced Performance: The Naive Retriever shows surprisingly strong and balanced performance across all metrics, making it a good baseline option when computational resources are limited.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Specialized Strengths:\n",
        "    - Multi-Query Retriever excels in noise sensitivity (0.4537), suggesting it's most robust to variations in query formulation.\n",
        "    - Semantic Chunking Retriever performs well on context recall (0.8667) and entity recall (0.7125), indicating it effectively captures semantic relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Efficiency vs. Effectiveness Tradeoff: While the Ensemble Retriever performs best, it also experienced timeout issues, suggesting higher computational demands. The Contextual Compression Retriever offers an excellent balance of high performance with fewer computational issues."

        "1. For Maximum Accuracy: Use the Ensemble Retriever when comprehensive information retrieval is critical and computational resources are available.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. For Balanced Performance: The Contextual Compression Retriever offers the best balance of precision and recall with reasonable computational demands.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. For Resource-Constrained Environments: The Naive Retriever provides surprisingly good results with minimal complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Avoid: The BM25 Retriever alone is not recommended for this type of content unless specifically needed for keyword-exact matching.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. For Production Systems: Consider implementing a tiered approach - start with the Naive or Contextual Compression retriever for most queries, and fall back to the Ensemble retriever for complex or high-importance queries.\n",
