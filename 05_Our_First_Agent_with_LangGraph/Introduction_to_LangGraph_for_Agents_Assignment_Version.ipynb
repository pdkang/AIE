        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",

        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-06-12\\nTitle: Exploring Fact Memorization and Style Imitation in LLMs Using QLoRA: An Experimental Study and Quality Assessment Methods\\nAuthors: Eugene Vyborov, Oleksiy Osypenko, Serge Sotnyk\\nSummary: There are various methods for adapting LLMs to different domains.

              "\"RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) that combines retrieval-based methods with generative models to improve the quality and accuracy of generated text. Here's how it works:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval**: In the first step, relevant documents or pieces of information are retrieved from a large corpus or database. This is typically done using a retrieval model that identifies the most relevant documents based on the input query.\\n\\n2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved documents are then used to augment the input query. This means that the information from the retrieved documents is combined with the original query to provide more context and background information.\\n\\n3. **Generation**: Finally, a generative model, such as a transformer-based language model, uses the augmented input to generate a response or piece of text. The additional context from the retrieved documents helps the model produce more accurate and contextually relevant outputs.\\n\\nRAG is particularly useful in scenarios where the model needs to generate responses based on a large and diverse set of information, such as in open-domain question answering or conversational AI. By leveraging both retrieval and generation, RAG can provide more informed and precise answers.\""

It involves creating input, instructional, and conversational prompts to minimize bias and improve the quality of AI outputs. This technique is crucial in various applications, including customer support, content generation, and data analysis. Prompt engineering is an iterative process that may require repeated prompting to achieve the desired results, ultimately leading to improved outcomes and cost savings ([Techopedia](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/prompt-engineering), [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/technology/prompt-engineering)).\n",

            "The history of prompt engineering can be traced back to the early days of code generation tools like CodeSmith and MyGeneration, which automated the generation of boilerplate code for common programming tasks. Over time, prompt engineering evolved with advancements in natural language processing (NLP) and reinforcement learning techniques. These developments have enhanced the capabilities of language models, making them more powerful, context-aware, and adaptable for a wide range of NLP applications. The introduction of attention mechanisms and reinforcement learning in 2017 further improved the controllability of prompt-engineered language models, allowing engineers to shape model behavior and address biases ([Promptly Substack](https://promptly.substack.com/p/a-journey-through-the-history-of), [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04438)).\n",

Recent research has focused on modular RAG frameworks, which decompose complex systems into independent modules, allowing for a more reconfigurable and efficient design.\n",

            "Fine-tuning is a process in machine learning where a pre-trained model is further trained on a smaller, task-specific dataset. This allows the model to adapt to specific tasks or domains while leveraging the general knowledge it has already acquired during its initial training on a larger dataset. Fine-tuning is particularly useful because it can significantly reduce the amount of data and computational resources required to train a model for a specific task, as the model starts with a strong foundation of general knowledge.\n",
            "\n",
            "Fine-tuning became prominent with the rise of transfer learning techniques, especially in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision. In NLP, the introduction of models like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) in 2018 popularized the concept of fine-tuning. BERT and similar models are pre-trained on large corpora of text and then fine-tuned on specific tasks such as sentiment analysis, question answering, or named entity recognition.\n",
